# Schulte Table

This game is called the "Schulte Table" or "Schulte Grid." It was named after the German psychologist Walter Schulte, who developed this tool in the early 20th century.

The Schulte Table is a grid, typically consisting of 5x5 or larger grid of randomly distributed numbers or letters. The goal is to find and point at or cross out the numbers or letters in sequential order as quickly as possible. It is used as a psychological test and training tool to assess and improve a person's ability to quickly scan and visually process information.

This exercise is believed to enhance concentration, peripheral vision, and rapid visual perception. It has been used by athletes, particularly Soviet Olympic athletes, as part of their training to improve their reaction times and visual processing skills.

The Schulte Table has also found applications in various fields, such as sports psychology, neuropsychology, and vision therapy, as a means to measure and enhance cognitive abilities related to visual attention and scanning.
